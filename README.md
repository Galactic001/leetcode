A collection of my solutions to LeetCode algorithmic problems. The main goal of this repository is to track my progress in data structures and algorithms (DSA) and to serve as a reference for common patterns.  
This is just a side hobby I do when I am not developing Games.  

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by problem number ranges (batches of 100) to keep the repository clean as the number of solutions grows.
